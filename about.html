          <p>
          This is the first website I have built, utilising just basic HTML and CSS. I hope to use it as a platform to present other 
          aspects of myself, such as other coding projects, hobbies, academic and professional projects, and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm a recent graduate from Heriot-Watt University, with a Masters in Chemical Engineering with Oil and Gas Technology. 
            I grew up in Orkney, Scotland, and currently based in the capital, Edinburgh.  Since graduating, 
            I have spent some time learning different aspects of programming, such as web design, machine learning and AWS. 
            I am comfortable with such languages as JavaScript, C, Python and Lua.   </p><p>
            I enjoy playing piano, and am fanatical about classical music. I read a wide range of subjects, with a focus history and economics.
            I am fortunate enough to have seen many places in the world, and I a currently
            learning Spanish and Turkish. I enjoy cycling around the city and when I am home in Orkney.
          </p>
          <p> I hope you enjoy my first website.</p>
